### What is Taxonomic Name Alignment?
-----
> Taxonomic name alignment is a method we can use to standardize the scientific names of specimens in our collections to the most up to date taxonomy as listed in a authority of choice. 


### Why is Taxonomic Alignment Important?
----
> Scientific names and the species they represent are hypotheses. As in all fields of science, these hypotheses should always be refined based upon the most current and accurate information. Species in the past may have been identified based upon a particular trait or an authority's species concept. As we collect more data from fields like systematics and population genetics, we are more capable of refining these designations to represent our most current knowledge. Its therefore important to standardize our collections to the most up to date designations based upon new information. 


### What Taxonomic Resources can we use to Align Names?

Taxonomic databases that contain name designations are called "catalogues". Catalogues contain the necessary information for aligning old names with their most current counterparts if they have changed. Due to scope, species concepts, and project aims there are quite a few catalogues to choose from when aligning names. Some catalogues are designed in large scope to encompass a large portion of the tree of life, while others are more focused on particular clades. Depending on the group your working with, different catalogues may offer more up to date expert designations.

### How are Catalogues Structured?
-----
> There are various formats depending on the catalogue, but in general they all share the feature of linking names by a relationship. Two common relationships we will see are: 
- **Accepted Name**: This relationship shows that the name searched is registered as the most current/valid name according to the catalogue. 
- **Synonym**: This relationship suggests that the name searched has been remapped to an alternative name according to the catalogue.

### This does mean that you need to have some knowledge of Github's interface, which is up next!
