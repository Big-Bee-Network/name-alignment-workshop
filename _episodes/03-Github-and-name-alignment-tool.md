### Getting started
---------------------------------
> To use Github you will need a github account as mentioned in the [setup instructions]. Please note you do NOT need Git downloaded onto your computer for this tutorial. We will be working in Github's graphical interface for the purpose of this lesson. 

> Once you have made you're account, you will likely be taken to a page showing you're home activity/github's recommendations. From there, we can nagivate to the top right corner that displays your profile icon, click it, then navigate to the tab that says "Your repositories", go ahead and click that as well.

### What is Github? 
--------------------------------
> Simply put github is a hosting service for software development and collaboration. Some of us use it to store versions of our code/analyses and others use it for development of software/applications. Today our aim isn't to utilize github for these aspects, but to interact with the name-alignment-tool that has been built on github. All you need to interact with the tool is to "clone" the template repository. That probably sounds complicated at first so lets break it down into a few steps. 

### What is a Repository or "Repo"?
---------------------------------
> Introduce the basics of what is a Repo and how they are useful for you and collaboration (BRIEF!) 
> Insert jpegs with red square boxes that denote where to click on the graphical interface to make repo, 
> Describe the options you have when making a repo (BRIEF!), insert images for lesson purposes

### Where can we find the name-alignment-tool and how do I use it?
> Link to globi's name-alignment-tool (alternatively could show searching for it) IF search show pictures...
> Introduce the basics of what's on a Repo, highlighting whats usually on a README, what are all of those file paths in the box, and how to use a template.
> Show that your copy is your own now! Feel free to add files and change things, if something breaks you can always delete it and copy a new one!
